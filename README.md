# Data Visualization with Python and Dash

This project is part of IBM Course about data visualization with Python and Dash.
The task consists in monitoring and reporting US domestic airline flights performance. 
By analyzing the performance of the reporting airline, we aim to improve the flight reliability, thereby improving customer reliability.

The data visualization task consist in building two main report, for period between 2005 and 2020:

1) Yearly airline performance report
2) Yearly average flight delay statistics

First report, the yearly airline performance,  consists of a dashboard, with 5 different charts. For the chosen year provide,

  Number of flights under different cancellation categories using bar chart.
  Average flight time by reporting airline using line chart.
  Percentage of diverted airport landings per reporting airline using pie chart.
  Number of flights flying from each state using choropleth map.
  Number of flights flying to each state from each reporting airline using treemap chart.
  
A screenshot of this report, for the year 2006, is shown in the Figure 1.

Second report, yearly average flight delay, consists of a dashboard, with 5 different charts. For a specific year between 2005 and 2020, there are built 5 line charts, showing:

  Monthly average carrier delay by reporting airline for the given year.
  Monthly average weather delay by reporting airline for the given year.
  Monthly average national air system delay by reporting airline for the given year.
  Monthly average security delay by reporting airline for the given year.
  Monthly average late aircraft delay by reporting airline for the given year.

A screenshot of this report, for the year 2018, is shown in the Figure 2.

The code is in Python, with Dash and Plotly.
